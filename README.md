## About The Project

Well, as the title goes - builds custom kernels for Void Linux based on [linux-tkg](https://github.com/Frogging-Family/linux-tkg) patches.

## Getting Started

To build custom kernels, I recommend to follow the following steps:

1. Install required packages

```
sudo xpbs-install git curl binutils xz tar util-linux
```

2. Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/70xH/void-kernel-builds.git
```

3. cd to the directory and run the shell file

```
cd void-kernel-builds
./xynator.sh
```

## Kernels

The followings are the list of kernels that will be and can be complied

[X] 5.14.9
[ ] 5.13.19
[ ] 5.12.19
[ ] 5.11.22
